/*** LitePost ('Core' version) ***/
/*** Oct 2009 - oscar arevalo - http://www.oscararevalo.com ****/


his is a port of the litePost sample application to the Core framework.

To execute this sample you must have the litePost code on your webserver available under "/litepost"; 
Drop the directory containing this application into the /litepost folder.

Also, litepost requires ColdSpring to work, so you will need that too.

The ColdSpring config assumes a mapping of /net to point to /litepost/cfc/net

Other than that there is no other requirements, all framework files required (the few of them) are located within the app directory.
